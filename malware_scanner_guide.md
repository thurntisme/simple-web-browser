# 🛡️ Malware Scanner Guide

## Overview

The Malware Scanner is a comprehensive security tool integrated into the browser that provides multi-layered file scanning capabilities to detect potential malware and security threats.

## Features

### 🔍 Detection Methods

1. **Extension-based Analysis**
   - Identifies potentially dangerous file extensions
   - Flags executable files (.exe, .scr, .bat, .cmd, etc.)
   - Warns about script files (.vbs, .js, .ps1, etc.)

2. **Hash-based Detection**
   - Compares file MD5 hashes against known malware database
   - Includes EICAR test file detection
   - Fast and accurate identification of known threats

3. **Signature-based Scanning**
   - Scans file content for known malware signatures
   - Detects suspicious patterns in binary and text files
   - Identifies common malware indicators

4. **Heuristic Analysis**
   - Analyzes code patterns for suspicious behavior
   - Detects obfuscated scripts and encoded commands
   - Identifies potentially malicious system calls

5. **Archive Scanning**
   - Scans contents of ZIP archives
   - Detects suspicious files within compressed archives
   - Prevents hidden malware in archive files

### 🚨 Threat Levels

- **Clean**: No threats detected
- **Suspicious**: Potentially dangerous but not confirmed malware
- **Malicious**: Confirmed malware or high-risk content
- **Error**: Scan failed or file inaccessible

### 📊 Comprehensive Reporting

- Detailed scan results with threat descriptions
- File information (size, type, timestamps)
- Security recommendations based on findings
- Export capabilities for audit trails

## How to Use

### Scanning Process

1. **Select File**
   - Click "📂 Browse" to select a file
   - Or drag and drop a file into the dialog

2. **Start Scan**
   - Click "🔍 Start Scan"
   - Monitor progress in real-time
   - View status updates during scanning

3. **Review Results**
   - Check the Summary tab for overview
   - Review Threats tab for detailed findings
   - Examine Details tab for technical information

4. **Take Action**
   - Follow security recommendations
   - Export results for documentation
   - Delete or quarantine suspicious files

## Security Recommendations

### For Clean Files
- ✅ File appears safe based on current analysis
- 🔄 Keep antivirus definitions updated
- 🔍 Monitor for suspicious behavior after execution

### For Suspicious Files
- ⚠️ Exercise extreme caution
- 🔍 Scan with multiple antivirus engines
- 🏠 Only run in isolated environment if necessary
- 📧 Verify file source and authenticity

### For Malicious Files
- 🚨 DO NOT execute the file
- 🗑️ Delete the file immediately
- 🔍 Run full system scan with updated antivirus
- 🔒 Check if system is already compromised

## Technical Details

### Supported File Types

- **Executables**: .exe, .scr, .com, .pif, .msi
- **Scripts**: .bat, .cmd, .vbs, .js, .ps1
- **Archives**: .zip, .rar, .7z, .tar, .gz
- **Documents**: All file types (content analysis)
- **System Files**: .dll, .sys, .drv

### Detection Signatures

The scanner includes signatures for:
- EICAR test file (harmless test virus)
- Common script-based malware patterns
- PowerShell exploitation techniques
- Command injection attempts
- Registry manipulation scripts

### Performance

- **Speed**: Scans up to 1MB of file content
- **Memory**: Efficient streaming for large files
- **Threading**: Non-blocking UI during scans
- **Progress**: Real-time status updates

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Signature Database**: Limited to built-in signatures
2. **Archive Support**: Currently supports ZIP files only
3. **File Size**: Scans first 1MB of large files
4. **Network**: No online threat intelligence integration
5. **Quarantine**: No automatic quarantine functionality

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Cloud Integration**: Connect to online threat databases
2. **Real-time Protection**: Monitor file system changes
3. **Advanced Heuristics**: Machine learning-based detection
4. **Quarantine System**: Automatic isolation of threats
5. **Scheduled Scans**: Automated periodic scanning

## Best Practices

### Before Scanning

1. **Update Definitions**: Ensure latest threat signatures
2. **Close Applications**: Stop unnecessary programs
3. **Backup Important Data**: Protect against false positives

### During Scanning

1. **Don't Interrupt**: Allow scans to complete fully
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for unusual patterns
3. **Note Findings**: Document any threats detected

### After Scanning

1. **Review Results**: Carefully examine all findings
2. **Take Action**: Follow security recommendations
3. **Document**: Export results for audit trails
4. **Follow Up**: Monitor system for suspicious activity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Scanner Won't Start**
- Check file permissions
- Verify Python dependencies
- Restart the browser application

**Scan Takes Too Long**
- Large files may take time
- Use Stop button if needed
- Check system resources

**False Positives**
- Review threat details carefully
- Verify file source and purpose
- Consider secondary scanning tools

**Export Fails**
- Check write permissions
- Verify disk space
- Try different file location

### Error Messages

- **"File not found"**: Selected file was moved or deleted
- **"Access denied"**: Insufficient permissions to read file
- **"Scan failed"**: Internal error during analysis
- **"Export failed"**: Cannot write to selected location

## Integration

### Browser Integration

The malware scanner is fully integrated with the browser:
- Context menu access from any webpage
- Tools menu integration with keyboard shortcut
- Status bar updates during scanning
- Consistent UI styling with browser theme
